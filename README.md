# wlsa_canteen_code_system
This is a website designed for optimizing the canteen congestion problem by rewarding students who go to canteen during the idle time. The canteen should setup the host in the canteen. When students enter the canteen during the idle time, a dynamic code is shown on the host. The students then collect points by redeeming the code shown in the canteen.
